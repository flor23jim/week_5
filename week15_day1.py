# Booleans
# Check Even or Odd: Write a program to check if a number entered by the user is even or odd.
# Input: Integer
# Output: "Even" or "Odd"

# number=int(input("please provide me with a number"))
# if (number% 2)==0:
#     print("the numebr is even") 
# else:
#     print("the number is odd") 

# Comparison Operators
# Max of Three Numbers: Compare three numbers entered by the user and print the largest.
# Input: Three integers
# Output: Largest number

# integer=int(input("please provide numbers"))
# integer1=int(input("please provide numbers"))
# integer2=int(input("please provide numbers"))
# print(max(integer,integer1,integer2))

# Decision Making
# Weekend or Weekday: Write a program that checks if a given day is a weekday or a weekend.
# Input: String ("Monday", "Tuesday", etc.)
# Output: "Weekday" or "Weekend"

# x=input("please provided me wiht a day")
# weekday=["monday","tuesday","wednesday","thurday","friday"]
# if x in weekday:
#     print("weekday")
# else:
#     print("weekend")

# List Comprehension
# Cubed Numbers: Create a list of cubed values for numbers from 1 to 10 using list comprehension.
# Output: List of cubes

# value=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# cubev=[x**3 for x in value]
# print(cubev)

# Logical Operators
# Divisible by 2 and 5: Check if a number is divisible by both 2 and 5.
# Input: Integer
# Output: "Divisible by 2 and 5" or "Not divisible by 2 and 5"

# num=int(input("give me a number"))
# if num%2 ==0 and num%5 ==0:
#     print("divisible by 2 and 5")
# else: 
#     print("not divisible by 2 and 5")

# Loops
# Count Down: Use a while loop to count down from 20 to 0.
# Output: Print each number

for i in range (21,0):
    print(i)
